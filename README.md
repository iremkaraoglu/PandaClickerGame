## Description

Panda Clicker is a 2D game and the aim is to touch the Panda image on the center of the screen. In each touch of the panda in the center, a small panda comes up to the screen and slides from the top of the screen. Meanwhile, a sound plays and the score increases.

When the score becomes a number that is a multiplier of 10, the device vibrates (using Haptic Feedback), and the user sees a particle animation on the screen.
